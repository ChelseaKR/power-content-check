"""The declared version, held against the tag that would make it true.

``pyproject.toml`` declares ``version = "0.1.0"``. Nothing here has ever been
tagged: ``git tag --list`` is empty on this checkout and on ``origin``. So the
number names no artifact, and until this file existed nothing in the repository
said so. The README carried no status line at all, and the Standards
Conformance table's Release & Versioning row read, in full, "Applies".

``CITATION.cff`` went further and carried ``date-released: "2026-08-18"``
against no tag and no GitHub Release. Citation tooling prints that field as the
date the software was released, so a reader who cited this tool got a release
date for a release that never happened. The date was real; it was just the date
of something else.

That is this repository's own dominant defect class turned on its packaging.
``docs/AUDITING.md`` and ``tests/test_fail_closed.py`` exist because a status
this tool cannot determine must never be published as a pass, and
``tests/test_registry.py`` exists because a check that enforces nothing must
not read like one that does. A version number with nothing behind it is the
same mistake in the metadata: absence rendered as a value. Measured across the
portfolio on 2026-09-06, twenty public repositories were in that shape.

Being pre-release is not the defect. Publishing the number in silence is. So
the rule sorts the declared version into one of two states.

*No tag exists*, which is where this repository is. Legitimate, and it passes,
but only while the README says so where a reader arrives: the ``**Status:**``
line, or the ``Release & Versioning`` row. The sentence has to name the version
``pyproject.toml`` declares, because that is what stops the disclosure going
stale. A bump to ``0.2.0`` under a README still explaining ``0.1.0`` reads
exactly like a current disclosure to anyone who does not diff the two.

*Tags exist and none names the declared version.* A defect, and a failure,
reporting the declared version and the newest tag, because "the version is
wrong" without both numbers sends the reader back to a shell to work out which
two things disagree.

The second state is unreachable from this repository today, so it is driven
from synthetic input on every run rather than waiting for a bad day, next to a
positive control so the rule cannot pass by never passing, and a sabotage of
the real README that asserts the substitution landed before reading the result.
A gate whose failing branch never executes is exactly what Track J of the
roadmap is about, one directory over: an implemented check that cannot reach
its deviation branch announces nothing.

Two things this file deliberately does not do.

It does not create a tag. Whether to cut one is the maintainer's call, and it
is not a decision a test gets to make by passing.

It does not reach the network, so it reports the tags this checkout holds and
has to run somewhere that could hold them. ``_why_tags_are_not_authoritative``
refuses to answer from a shallow clone or one configured ``--no-tags``: "no
tags found" from a checkout that was never given any is the vacuous pass this
whole file exists to prevent. ``actions/checkout`` fetches no tags at its
default depth, so the verify job checks out with ``fetch-depth: 0``.

One consequence worth knowing before the first release: cut the tag on the
commit that declares the version. Merging a version bump ahead of its tag puts
``main`` into the failing state above, accurately, because for that window the
repository really does declare a version nothing was tagged for.
